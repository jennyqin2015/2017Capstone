The First Trust NASDAQ-100 Technology Sector ETF tracks an equal-weighted index of the largest NASDAQ-listed U.S. technology stocks.
QTEC offers quirky exposure to the tech sector: It equally-weights large-cap tech stocks that happen to be listed on NASDAQ. Investors who want small-cap, or even just representative tech exposure, should look elsewhere. QTEC's main appeal is its equal weighting, which drastically drops Apple's huge market footprint. However, its NASDAQ focus causes it to miss some major tech giants like IBM altogether. The net result is that QTEC tilts small compared to our benchmark, and heavily overweights semiconductors at the expense of software & IT services. Investors are interested in spite of these oddities. The fund trades heavily each day and spreads are generally small, while underlying liquidity is excellent. QTEC's Efficiency is a mixed bag: a huge asset base means the fund is quite stable, but its price is high and its weak tracking significantly raises realized holding costs.
